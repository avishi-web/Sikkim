<h1>Mental Health in Sikkim</h1>
<br>
<p>
<h3>1. Psychological Disorders in Sikkim and Comorbidities</h3>
Sikkim has one of the highest suicide rates in India, often attributed to factors such as unemployment, substance abuse, and social isolation. In Sikkim, common psychological <br> disorders include PTSD due to natural calamities like earthquakes and landslides, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) due to the region's geography, and substance abuse <br> disorders linked to alcoholism and drug addiction. The prevalence of these disorders often leads to comorbid conditions:
<br>
- Depression: Often observed in conjunction with anxiety and substance abuse disorders. High rates of alcoholism exacerbate depressive symptoms.
<br>
- Anxiety: Frequently coexists with depression and sometimes leads to substance abuse as a coping mechanism.
<br>
- Substance Abuse: A major issue in Sikkim, with alcohol and drug addiction rates being higher than the national average, often leading to depression and anxiety disorders.

<br>
- Government Support: Both regions benefit from central government initiatives, but Delhi has more localized programs due to its urban setting.
